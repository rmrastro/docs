% "including the unique research

% research infrastructure."


Led by NSF's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) which deploys in 2023, astronomy is entering a new era of
unprecedented deep-imaging data sets that will survey huge volumes of the universe when it was only one-half or
one-third its current age.  These epochs mark important but poorly understood transitions in cosmic history. Early
galaxies were emerging from a ``primordial soup'' of gas and dust, assembling now fossilized structures that may be
detected even within our own Milky Way.  Meanwhile, the rate of cosmic expansion was beginning to accelerate, as the
Universe became increasingly dominated by ``Dark Energy,'' whose origin remains the single greatest mystery in
astronomy and cosmology today.

Since Edwin Hubble's observations over 100 years ago, major advances in our understanding of the universe have come
from the two-step process of first taking images of the sky to locate sources of interest and then obtaining
information-rich spectroscopy to reveal the nature of those sources.  A modern example is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) whose combination of panoramic broad-band ``imaging'' followed by dedicated spectroscopy yielded an
unprecedented sample of over 1 million galaxies, mapping the present-day universe and making SDSS the most highly cited
survey in the history of astronomy.

% Because a quality spectrum requires far more observing time per source than an image, SDSS pioneered ``high multiplex''
% spectrographs, capable of \emph{simultaneous} spectroscopy of hundreds of objects.

LSST's all-sky images will be 1,000 times deeper and detect far more distant galaxies than SDSS, but \textbf{no current
U.S. facility is capable of obtaining spectroscopic followup of LSST} at a level required to capitalize on our \$1B
investment in that project.  In fact, SDSS-like spectroscopic followup of 1 million galaxies at LSST depths would
require 300 years of observing on the largest telescopes with current instrumentation!

The only way forward is encapsulated in one of NSF's ``10 Big Ideas,'' namely \emph{Harnessing the Data Revolution} in
order to maximize the information content of LSST via machine learning of optimally-designed spectroscopic training
sets.  This proposal presents a coordinated framework with three critical components necessary for success in this
endeavor: 1) Development of statistical approaches to specific and ambitious data-science challenges that will address
key questions about transitional epochs in cosmic history; 2) Design of Keck-FOBOS\footnote{Keck-FOBOS: The Keck Observatory Fiber Optic Broadband Optical Spectrograph}, a state-of-the-art spectroscopic
facility on one of the world's largest telescopes optimized for obtaining spectroscopic training sets for LSST
followup; 3) Design and execution of a ``FOBOS Public Survey'' and construction of a data-serving platform to provide
high-level data products and training sets to the U.S. community.  This MSRI-1 design proposal lays out the path for
maximizing the panoramic imaging of LSST with spectroscopic followup.  Through a subsequent MSRI proposal we will
deliver on our goals with an instrument deployment in 2025 and completed spectroscopic followup with associated
public-ready training sets made available as LSST's primary survey concludes in 2029.

We address data science challenges in four scientific areas in order to guide our instrument and survey design:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Significantly more powerful probes of Dark Energy and Cosmology
	\item Comprehensive understanding of the proto-galaxy ecosystem at $z\sim2$
	\item Archaeological studies of our own Milky Way galaxy and its satellites to unravel their specific journeys
	through this transition.
	\item Time domain spectroscopy...(?)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Community Priority} 
\label{sec:community}
\noindent\comment{3/4 page}

% \noindent "evidence, such as workshop
% reports or other publicly available indicators, that the infrastructure
% is a priority for a research community or important for a recognized NSF
% priority area such as one of NSF’s research Big Ideas."

% The coming decade will benefit from  major investments in both the depth and breadth of astronomical observations.  The James Webb Space Telescope will provide our deepest views yet, probing the first billion years of cosmic time over narrow sightlines.  At the same time, LSST's panoramic imaging will survey broad cosmic volumes of unprecedented size, detecting the majority of luminous sources a few billion years later.  LSST's optical imaging will be complemented by space-based near-infrared imaging from Euclid and eventually's NASA's WFIRST. 

The need for spectroscopic followup in the LSST era was made clear in the National Research Council's 2015 report, ``Optimizing the U.S. Ground-Based Optical and Infrared Astronomy System'' \citep{NAP21722} which made the following recommendation:

\begin{quote}
The National Science Foundation should support the development of a wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability on a medium- or large-aperture telescope in the Southern Hemisphere to enable a wide variety of science, including follow-up spectroscopy of Large Synoptic Survey Telescope targets. Examples of enabled science are studies of cosmology, galaxy evolution, quasars, and the Milky Way.
\end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
% The science reach of LSST could be substantially enhanced by developing for the U.S. astronomy community a very-wide-field, massively multiplexed, spectroscopic capability. This facility should be capable of overlapping the majority of the sky area covered by the LSST surveys. Such a wide-field instrument or instruments should be sufficiently multiplexed to enable spectroscopic surveys of tens of millions of objects over several years. The science case for such a capability is rich for objects of a wide range of brightnesses...
% \end{quote}

% Therefore MSE as currently envisioned:  (https://www.noao.edu/meetings/2020decadal/files/PHall_MSE_Tucson_201802v3.pdf)
% •  will have access to 74% of the primary LSST footprint
% •  will meet its science requirements over 59% of the primary
% LSST area
% •  will observe at airmass < 1.4 (the LSST limit in its primary
% footprint) over 51% of the primary LSST area.

In addition to this report, further details of spectroscopic needs for LSST in all science areas were disseminated
after a 2013 workshop on this topic organized by the National Optical
Astronomy Observatory (NOAO).  Based on these recommendations, we propose the Keck-FOBOS instrument coupled
with a suite of data-driven tools to address LSST's spectroscopic requirements at a final cost 20 times less than
a new Southern Hemisphere facility. Located in Hawaii, Keck-FOBOS would have access to greater than 70\% of the LSST
footprint, more than adequate for our primary goal of building powerful spectroscopic training sets.  FOBOS would complement future ambitious facilities that could cover wider areas (several deg$^2$ per pointing) at shallower depths.

The need for deep spectroscopic followup is particularly acute for LSST's major cosmological probes which rely on ``photometric redshifts.''  \citet{newman15} summarize the case and describe a redshift survey which, if carried out with Keck-FOBOS, would increase LSST's Dark Energy Figure-of-Merit by a factor of 50\% at a cost of less than 5\% of the LSST budget.  The urgent case for spectroscopic redshift training has been the subject of numerous publications \citep[e.g.,][]{laureijs11,masters15, hemmati18}.  

Meanwhile, the astronomy community recognizes that the coming era of ``Big Data'' astronomy culminating in LSST
necessitates ``harnessing the data revolution.''  Wide-spread community interest in advanced data science techniques
continues to grow amidst calls for educational programs, conference series, and research funding to support the
growth of a new field, ``Astroinformatics,'' which exploits the interface between astrophysics and statistics
\citep{borne09}.  Astronomy's largest organizations, including the American Astronomical Society and the International
Astronomical Union, have supported active working groups on astroinformatics and astrostatistics since 2015.  LSST
itself has built the Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration and partnered with NSF to fund the Data Science
Fellowship Program to train astronomy graduate students in data science techniques.  Our proposal builds on and
contributes to these ongoing efforts.

% The coming decade will benefit from  major investments in both the depth and breadth of astronomical observations.  The
% James Webb Space Telescope will provide our deepest views yet, probing the first billion years of cosmic time over
% narrow sightlines.  At the same time, LSST's panoramic imaging will survey broad cosmic volumes of unprecedented size,
% detecting the majority of luminous sources a few billion years later.  LSST's optical imaging will be complemented by
% space-based near-infrared imaging from Euclid and eventually's NASA's WFIRST.

% The lack of telescope facilities capable of providing required spectrocopic followup for LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST is an urgent problem.  


\subsection{Data-Driven Science Challenges}
\label{sec:goals}

We introduce data science challenges in three science areas that will be addressed in this proposal.  Each enables significant advances in our understanding of transitional epochs in cosmic history by leveraging FOBOS-derived spectroscopic training sets to maximize the information that can be extracted from LSST.  These challenges are intentionally ambitious in order to push the boundaries of current astrostatistics techniques and applications.  The level of success we achieve in each challenge over the next two years will define the ``readiness'' of these applications.  Based on this readiness, we will refine the FOBOS Public Survey design and requirements on delivered training sets in the next (MSRI-2) phase of this project.

The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the discovery of an era
of acceleration in the expansion rate of the universe that sets in when
the universe was roughly half its current age.  This accelerated
expansion is often attributed to a mysterious ``Dark Energy,'' but the
amplitude of this vacuum energy density is 120 orders of magnitude
smaller than what naive models would predict.

Dark Energy is perhaps the single most important unsolved problem in
cosmology and astrophysics.  As such, it has inspired enormous
world-wide effort and the construction of dedicated ground and
space-based facilities.  These include LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST.  The
goal of these experiments is the precision mapping of cosmic structure.
Because this structure expands as the universe expands, precise measures
of cosmic structure allow us to reconstruct the cosmic expansion
history, and at sufficient levels of detail, distinguish among various
Dark Energy models.

Many of the most important cosmological probes require galaxy
``redshifts,'' a Doppler-like shift in the observed wavelengths of
emitted light, as distant galaxies appear to recede from us as a result
of cosmic expansion.  Cosmological models, which provide access to Dark
Energy parameters, are constrained in part via the conversion of
redshift into distance.  Accurate redshifts are conventionally derived
via spectroscopy by fitting the observed wavelength locations of
spectral features.  Less precise redshifts, so-called ``photometric
redshifts'' (or photo-$z$s) can be estimated with imaging photometry
alone, a compelling option for large and faint data sets where
spectroscopic redshifts are infeasible.  But, ``to infer cosmological
parameters not limited by systematic errors, accurate redshift
measurements are needed'' \citep {hemmati18}.  

Spectroscopic redshifts are critical for both the training of
photometric redshift algorithms and for calibrating results in order to
correct for biases.  Complete photo-$z$ training samples can
\emph{increase the Dark Energy Figure of Merit in LSST by 50\%}
\citep{newman15} and Keck-FOBOS is particularly powerful in this respect
because it has no redshift desert.  Keck-FOBOS can measure spec-$z$s
above $z > 1.5$ via rest-frame UV features, eliminating the need for
exensive, space-based near-IR spectroscopy.

Photometric Redshifts ($\sigma_z/(1+z) \lesssim 0.005$ at i(AB) $<$
25.3) with Targeted Training Sample sizes of $<$10k}.  Our proposed
FOBOS instrument is ideally suited to providing the spectroscopic
training defined in \citet{newman15}, but a complete program would
require a 400-night investment in 10 m telescope time.  This challenge
demands a reduction in the required FOBOS training sample by a factor of
$\sim$4 via clever application of state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques.

Neural network trained photo-$z$s have long been recognized for
providing the best precision when sufficient training sets are available
\citep[e.g.][]{bundy06}, and significant effort is underway in
optimizing their application to future cosmological imaging surveys.
\citet{hemmati18} for example have exploited Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs,
Fig \ref {fig:SOM}) to sort multiband photometric data by observed
redshift in order to select optimized training samples for spectroscopic
followup.




\subsubsection{A Comprehensive Picture of the Proto-galaxy Ecosystem}
\label{sec:galaxies}
\noindent \comment{1 page}

Roughly 4 billion years after the Big Bang ($z \sim 2$), the universe
entered a key epoch in which proto-galaxies transitioned from
interacting, gas-rich systems into the more ordered, star-dominated
structures that populate the universe today.  This period marks the peak
of global star formation rate and galaxy assembly history.   To
understand it, we must not only study the galaxy population at this
epoch but the entire galaxy ``ecosystem'' which includes their
gas-filled environments.  The goal is to build a comprehensive picture
of the physical processes that fuel proto-galaxy growth, shape their
internal structure, and influence their environment.

LSST's panoramic imaging will detect huge numbers of galaxies at this
epoch.  Targeted followup with Keck-FOBOS will allow us to ascribe
detailed galaxy and environmental information from deep spectroscopic
training samples to the much larger cosmic volumes surveyed with
broad-band imaging.

\noindent {\bf Data-Science Challenge \ref{phot}: Apply Deep Learning to
infer star formation rates and formation histories, dust content, wind
properties, and stellar masses from $z \sim 2$ photometry}.  The range
of observed spectral types is remarkably constrained by broad-band
imaging (Figure \ref{fig:SOM}, right panel), suggesting a far greater
potential for imaging data to reveal physical properties with sufficient
training than conventional modeling of spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) would suggest.  Applying machine learning, our challenge is to
deliver SDSS-like information for millions of imaged galaxies at $z \sim
2$.  With simulated data sets, we will investigate derived uncertainties
and biases and explore benefits from incorporating additional imaging
information like morphology, structure, and size from a wide range of
wave-bands (e.g., LSST plus Euclid plus WFIRST).  The exercise will
define requirements for Keck-FOBOS instrument performance and the FOBOS
Public Survey design.

\chal{uv}
%
\noindent {\bf Data-Science Challenge \ref{uv}: Enable label transfer
from rest-frame optical to UV stellar and ISM indicators}.  There are
many powerful gas and stellar spectral features just redward of the
Lyman-$\alpha$ line at 1216 \AA.  By combining Keck-FOBOS UV and near-IR
spectroscopy (e.g., from PFS) at $z \sim 2$, we can transfer ``labels''
best modeled in the rest-frame optical to spectra at UV wavelengths, at
least for certain types of galaxies.  This ``label transfer'' will
dramatically enhance interpretation of JWST discoveries of the first
galaxies ($z \sim 10$) for which rest-frame UV imaging and spectroscopy
will be most accessible.  A similar application can ascribe the escape
fraction of Lyman continuum radiation observed in the Keck-FOBOS Public
Survey to constrain the sources responsible for ``reionization'' at $z
\sim 6$.  With simulated spectral observations, we will determine the
extent of label transfer that is possible and set requirements on
training samples.

\chal{lowsnr}
%
\noindent {\bf Data-Science Challenge \ref{lowsnr}: Train short
spectroscopic exposures in combination with LSST photometry to provide
environmental diagnostics for 1M galaxies at $z=1$--$2$}.  Photometric
redshifts, while acceptable in large cosmological analyses, wash out
information about the local position of galaxies with respect to one
another.  To characterize a galaxy's local environment and identify its
neighbors requires (observationally expensive) spectroscopic redshifts
(spec-$z$s).  However, with improved photometric redshifts available
from Challenge \ref{photozs} and strong priors on spectral types
(Challenge \ref{phot}), machine learning techniques can yield
\emph{spectroscpic} redshifts at much lower signal-to-noise than
conventional redshift measurements. Specifically, our challenge is to
develop a methodology that can measure 300 km s$^{-1}$ accuracy
spec-$z$s on spectra obtained in just 10 minutes with Keck-FOBOS.  This
would enable an SDSS-like environmental study of 1M galaxies at
$z=1$--$2$ in just 20 nights of 10 m telescope time, making it a
compelling sub-component of the Keck-FOBOS Public Survey.

\subsubsection{Unraveling the Formation History of our Local Group of Galaxies}
\label{sec:localgroup}
\noindent \comment{1 page}

While only a single realization of the galaxy-formation process, our
Local Group provide unparalleled opportunities to study galaxies in
exquisite detail, by virtue of being able to spatially resolve their
constituent parts.  In fact, the Gaia satellite (ref) is currently
revolutionizing our understanding of our Milky Way Galaxy, providing
distances and on-sky motions for more than a billion stars spanning the
full extent of its disk.  These data represent a gigantic leap forward
in our ability to construct a history of the Milky Way by effectively
tracing its stellar populations and dynamical structures back in time.
However, the Gaia data are still limited: Fewer than 10\% of stars will
have a full complement of three-dimensional space motions, fewer than
0.3\% will have the basic stellar parameter measurements needed to
classify the stellar type, and only 0.1\% will have measured chemical
abundances.  Existing and ongoing surveys, like SEGUE, RAVE, and APOGEE,
and planned surveys, like WEAVE and 4MOST (refs), provide critical
supplementary observations, but these efforts only just begin to fulfill
the potential of the Gaia astrometric data.  Directly observing the all
1.7 billion stars is simply untenable for the foreseeable future.

Instead, a growing number of studies aim to infer the necessary
measurements using novel applications of machine-learning.  For example,
Ness et al.\ have developed {\it The Cannon}, a supervised learning
algorithm that uses spectra with known stellar parameters to label
spectra where those parameters are unknown.  In one application, they
determined three fundamental parameters for 55000 APOGEE spectra using a
1\% training sample.  Additionally, Ting et al.\ have developed {\it The
Payne}, which uses a neural network and theoretical stellar spectra to
determine 25 stellar labels.  In both of these applications, careful
attention has to be given to the limitations of the training sample,
similar to the SOM example provided in Figure 1.  At their core,
machine-learning algorithms, particularly supervised learning, are only
as good as the parameter space spanned by their training sets.

\medskip \chal{gaia} \noindent {\bf Data-Science Challenge \ref{gaia}:
Stellar parameter determinations for a billion stellar spectra.}  To
realize the full potential of the Gaia astrometric catalog, one needs
the full 6D phase space for each star and its chemical abundance
pattern.  Although anything more than simple total metallicity
measurements are out of reach for FOBOS, a strategically developed
training set observed at high S/N can be used for kinematics and simple
stellar parameter determination.

% Beyond its internal chemodynamical history, LSST will also reveal
% hundreds of faint Milky Way satellites, as well as discover new
% satellites of the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies, extending the
% census of these galaxies.  These faint galaxies provide critical tests
% of the hierarchical formation of the Local Group.

\section{Project Implementation}
\label{sec:project}

This proposal supports design work from November 2019 through September 2021 on the Keck-FOBOS instrumentation and the
interface between the instrument design and the envisioned FOBOS Public Survey plan, associated operational modes,
advanced data analysis tools, and final data products.  Design work on the complete package of hardware, software, and
data product deliverables is necessary to maximize the science return of the FOBOS Project.  Having advanced each of
these key components through preliminary design, we will request NSF MSRI-2 funding in 2021 to build and deploy the
instrumentation at the telescope, carry out the survey, and publicly serve the data products.  FOBOS would see first
light in 2025 and carry a total cost of \$32M (without contingency in 2019 dollars).  While we focus the current
request on work required for the preliminary design phase, we outline the overall project plan and final deliverables
in order to motivate this work.

\subsection{Keck-FOBOS Instrument Concept}
\label{sec:concept}
\noindent \comment{1 page}

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \vskip -0.1in
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FOBOSatKeck_v1.pdf}
 \caption{\small Rendering of FOBOS instrument systems deployed at the Keck II Nasmyth port.  By mounting the FOBOS spectrographs under the Nasmyth platform, other instruments like DEIMOS can maintain access to the telescope.}\label{fig:layout}
\end{figure}

Mounted at the Keck II Telescope's Nasmyth focus, the Fiber Optic Broadband Optical Spectrograph (FOBOS) will be one of
the most powerful spectroscopic facilities in the next decade.  FOBOS consists of several key components (Fig).  A
compensating lateral atmospheric dispersion corrector (CLADC) ensures that target light from all wavelengths falls on
allocated fibers while also correcting image aberrations at the edges of the 20 arcmin diameter Keck field that result
from the telescope design.  The final lens surface in the 3-lens CLADC also serves as the mounting plate for roaming
Starbugs fiber positioners.  Starbugs patrol a large on-sky area, enabling flexible targeting configurations that can
be dynamically adjusted during observations.

A total of 1800 150 $\mu$m core diameter fibers are deployed at the curved focal plane, which rotates and translates to
maintain image positions as the telescope tracks across the sky.  The fiber run is kept at less than $\sim$10 m to
maintain high throughput at UV wavelengths, and special care is given to stress-relief cabling to minimize variable
focal ratio degradation over the fiber run.

Sets of 600 fibers feed each of three identical spectrographs.  Each spectrograph uses a series of dichroics to divide
the fiber output into four wavelength channels with combined coverage from 310 to 1000 nm and mid-channel spectral
resolutions of $R \sim 3500$.  The dispersed light in each channel is focused by an f/1.1 catadioptric camera and
recorded by an on-axis CCD mounted at the center of the first camera lens element.  Spectrographs are mounted in a
temperature controlled housing installed under the Nasmyth Deck to allow space for other Keck instruments to access the
Nasmyth port.  The end-to-end instrument throughput is greater than 30\% at all wavelengths.

FOBOS includes observatory level systems for precise instrument calibration using dome-interior screen illumination, a
metrology system for accurate fiber positioning, and guide cameras for field acquisition and guiding.  The instrument
design envisions future upgrades including alternate collecting modes that deploy multiple fiber bundles, feeds to
other fiber-based spectrographs at different wavelengths or spectral resolutions, and the ability to support and
benefit from image corrections with Ground-Layer Adaptive Optics.



\subsection{Keck-FOBOS Instrument Design Effort}
\label{sec:design}
\noindent \comment{1 page}

Keck-FOBOS will complete its current conceptual design phase in October 2019.  Funding from this proposal will support preliminary design beginning in November 2019.  A detailed schedule of activities is attached.  Major components of the preliminary design effort are described below.

\noindent \textbf{Atmospheric Dispersion Compensator (ADC).} The opto-mechanical design, tolerancing, lens cell design, motion systems, and software controls design of the ADC will be completed.  We will complete a competitive bid selection of optics vendors so that upon passing the the FOBOS Preliminary Design Review (PDR), large lens procurement can begin immediately.  This procurement is a long-lead item in the overall schedule.

\noindent \textbf{Focal Plane System.} The final ADC lens element serves as the focal plane mounting plate for the fiber positioners.  This focal plane system must rotate and translate to track the field and refraction angles from the ADC.  Mechanical design, including flexure analysis and the selection of drive mechanisms and vendors will be completed.  This system also defines one of the interfaces to the Keck Telescope and must comply with Keck Observatory space envelopes, servicing needs, and other requirements.  The focal plane system also interfaces with guide cameras for field acquisition and guiding.

\noindent \textbf{Starbugs fiber positionsers.} Starbugs are a positioning technology developed and deployed by the
Australian Astronomical Observatory (AAO) which has partnered with our team to generate a conceptual design for
Starbugs in the context of FOBOS.  Design requirements for Starbugs in FOBOS are more relaxed than the currently on-sky
TAIPAN instrument thanks to the larger physical plate scale at Keck.  AAO will serve as a vendor during preliminary
design but is interested in exploring a partnership and in-kind contribution model in the construction phase.  In addition to the Starbugs themselves, a fiber metrology system (for accurate closed-loop positioning) will also be developed.

\noindent \textbf{Fiber System.} We will complete the optical design and processing plan for affixing forward optics
lenses to each fiber's head (these demagnify and speed up the beam for proper fiber coupling).  A micro-lens array
solution will be developed for a central, fixed-position 4.5-arcsec diameter IFU for fast source acquisition.  With vendors selected, we will be ready to begin prototyping.  We will
research anti-reflective coating vendors and options and detail throughput and stress performance specifications.  This
workpackage also includes the stress-relief cable system and fiber termination hardware and processing.

\noindent \textbf{Spectrographs.} The optical systems and components (slit, collimator, dichroics, gratings, and camera), an analysis of acceptable tolerances and performance, their mechanical supports, software controls, and the overall enclosure will all be advanced through preliminary design.  Vendors for major components will complete competitive bids.  Detectors, cryostats, read-out electronics and systems for thermal management will be designed and associated vendor relationships secured. We will complete a preliminary assembly and integration plan.

\noindent \textbf{Calibration System.} This package includes design of an interior dome screen and projection system for injecting calibration sources with sufficient spatial uniformity and stability into the instrument.  We will work with the Observatory to develop an integration and controls plan.  No such calibration system currently exists at Keck.

\noindent \textbf{Auxiliary Systems.} Design of auxiliary systems includes Nasmyth platform interfaces, utilities access, fiber routing and support, thermal control and vibration control systems.


\subsection{Addressing Data Science Challenges and Designing the FOBOS Public Survey}
\label{sec:survey}
\noindent \comment{1 page}

With our team of leading experts on data science applications to astronomy, we will tackle the Data Science Challenges
laid out in this proposal by supporting continuing research and organizing two focused workshops to encourage
engagement from the broader astrostatistics community.  These workshops will connect with ongoing activities of LSST's
Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration and Data Science Fellowship Programs.  At the end of the proposal
period, we will publish the results of work on these challenges and make public resulting software packages.

The resulting success of the Data Science Challenge activities will define their level of readiness and set
requirements on the associated training sets to be delivered by the FOBOS Public Survey.  The detailed design of the
survey and embedded training sets will be completed in the next phase of this project (MSRI-2).  The anticipated survey
will consist of multiple, combined programs with integrated tiers of exposure time and target density.  The complete
photo-$z$ training survey described in \citet{newman15} would require 15 independent pointings, each spanning 0.1
deg$^2$ with a target density of 6 arcmin$^{-2}$ (8 arcmin$^{-2}$ when including $z > 1.5$ galaxies accessible in the
UV with Keck-FOBOS), perfectly matched to the Keck-FOBOS field-of-view and target density.  With a conservative
exposure time of 100 hours to reach 75\% redshift completeness for 40,000 galaxies with $i_{\rm AB} < 25.3$, the Neman
survey would require 400 nights.  Challenge \ref{photoz} would reduce the required survey duration by a factor of at
least four.  Meanwhile the extreme depths and flux-limited selection are likely also requirements for training sets
associated with Challenges \ref{phot}, \ref{uv}.

A wider and shallower survey component is envisioned for Challenges \ref{lowsnr} and \ref{gaia}.  With 10-minute
integrations, a 52 deg$^2$ Keck-FOBOS sample of environmental diagnostics for 1 million galaxies could be carried out
in less than 20 nights.  This program would sample at $z \sim 1.5$ the same cosmic volume as SDSS.  A program of a
similar scale would provide training set data for inference of stellar parameters in the Milky Way.  These shallow programs would be integrated with the deeper components described above into a single survey plan.



% The components of the FPS are as follows:
%     - Photo-z training samples (Newman, Masters)
%         - z>1.5 in the blue
%         - z<1.5 in the red
%     - Ly continuum
%         - z~2 in the blue
%         - z~7 in the red
%     - Machine-learning the SDSS but at z~2


\subsection{Target Allocation with Artificial Intelligence}
\label{sec:targeting}
\noindent \comment{1/2 page}

Traditionally, target allocation involves laborious hands-on
optimization of a set of desired targets, the allowed positions of
entrance apertures, and constraints on the pointing center for precise
target acquisition and tracking.  These activities are typically
preformed days in advance of any observations and inflexible to the
actual observing conditions or any real-time decision making on the
observing night.  This inflexibility can be hardware related, such as
the pre-drilled metal sheets used to provide fiber entrance apertures in
SDSS, or software related, such as with interfaces that are overly user
intensive.

For both our public survey and its long-term operation, FOBOS will avoid
these limitations and allow for fast, dynamic reallocation of fibers to
maximize its efficiency.  First, we use the Starbugs positioning system
to largely mitigate the hardware limitations to FOBOS's flexibility to
real-time reallocation of fibers.  Second, as another data-science
challenge, we will develop software that efficiently optimizes targets
for allocation given a database of sources to be observed, the aggregate
data quality for the spectra obtained of the target using a quick-look
reduction package, {\it and real-time assessments of the observing
conditions.}  Finally, each target will have an expected data quality
metric that will be used to decide when the observation has successfully
met the observing request allowing for reallocation of individual
fibers.

\medskip \chal{target} \noindent {\bf Data-Science Challenge
\ref{target}: Intelligent target allocation algorithms that integrate
multiple observing programs and reallocate fibers based on real-time
assessments of observing conditions and the aggregate data quality of
each target.}  FOBOS will generally be able to optimize observations for
multiple programs with vastly different target densities and
exposure-time requirements.  We will build a database with efficiency
and observing success metrics and aggregate data quality for all targets
that have been observed.  Queries to this database will allow the
software to learn which observations should be successful, among all
possible observations for any given pointing and observing night.  For
example, if conditions are slightly less than optimal, the Starbugs
would quickly be reconfigured to target brighter objects in a given
field.  During survey operations, we expect this to be the primary mode
of allocating fibers; however, we will also provide a PI override for
specific targets and allow for unallocated fibers to be assigned to
targets drawn from an observatory-level ``filler" database.

%   - maintains a database with observational progress on individual
%     targets in the survey and
%   - dynamically reallocates fibers based on real-time assessments of
%     the aggregate S/N of each target to meet the specific need of each
%     science case.

% This requires significant design and testing of a combined software
% package and hardware interface.  Specific considerations involve (1)
% fast and robust reduction procedures (cf. MaNGA DOS) that can assess
% the aggregate data and (2) a responsive database with a schema
% optimized for real-time decision making to select targets for
% (re)acquisition while accounting for collision limitations.  Provided
% enough design effort, this lends itself to a machine-learning
% application.

\subsection{Publicly Available Automated Data Products}
\label{sec:DAP}
\noindent \comment{1/2 page}

The typical proprietary period for raw data acquired at Keck is 18
months.  However, typical of other public surveys (e.g., SDSS), this
period will be shortened to one year for the FOBOS Public Survey.

Both as part of our design effort and for long-term use, we will develop
a data-reduction pipeline, building on work already done for other
fiber-based observations, like SDSS and DESI.  This software will
provide both the quick reduction assessments needed for our dynamic
targeting system and the more detailed reduction to produce the data for
scientific analysis.  Reduced data will be delivered to the community
(e.g., via the Keck Observatory Archive) after the proprietary periods
are finished for {\it both} PI-led and public survey observations.

Finally, we will also provide a data-analysis pipeline that provides
high-level data products.  There are two aspects to analysis of the
data.  First, we will provide software to perform the traditional
measurements of properties like Doppler shift, emission-line strengths,
and internal kinematics that are measured from FOBOS-observed spectra.
This software will build on existing software we have built for the
SDSS-IV MaNGA survey (Westfall et al.), and it will be executed for {\it
any} data taken with FOBOS and released along with the reduced spectra.
This is a substantial effort and unheard of for observations taken
outside of a large-scale survey effort.  Second, we will provide the
results of our various machine-learning applications in the FOBOS Public
Survey (e.g., the LSST-source redshifts as determined by the FOBOS
observed training set).

Important to the success of both the data-reduction and data-analysis
software will be PI and community involvement in their refinement to
meet the needs of specific science applications.  These software
packages will be open source and publicly served (e.g., using GitHub).

% Beyond the raw data, the survey will provide reduced and derived
% products immediately (cf. MaNGA DAP).  The latter will be true of both
% the data from the public survey (released immediately) and indeed {\it
% any} data taken with the FOBOS instrument after the nominal 18-month
% proprietary period.  For the latter, we will encourage involvement of
% the program PI in refining the data-reduction and data-analysis
% software and its execution to garner the most from its application to
% their data.  Community involvement in a common software development
% obviates the need for different groups to retread old ground.

\subsection{Akamai: Training the next generation of Hawaiian STEM professionals}
\noindent \comment{1/2 page}

Led by the Institute for Scientist and Engineer Educators (ISEE) at
UCSC, the Akamai program provides resources for STEM training of
Hawaiian college students through internships and professional
development courses.  Akamai particularly aims to serve the Native
Hawaiian population and other under-represented groups; approximately a
quarter of all interns are Native Hawaiian and 38\% are women.
Traditionally, most Akamai interns are pursuing engineering or 
computer science in their undergraduate education.

ISEE and the Akamai program already have deep connections to the
W.~M.~Keck Observatory, involving many interns in projects related to
instrument and observatory development over the past decade.  We aim to
involve Akamai interns in the development of the FOBOS instrument
design, a software-based simulator that will inform the instrument
design and eventually result in a sensitivity calculator and the
data-reduction pipeline, and the many machine-learning applications
germane to our public survey.  In fact, we have already had an Akamai
intern work with us to setup a fiber test-bench at UCSC during Summer
2018.  We are excited by the opportunity to include funding for these
interns as part of our proposal and continue to seek new opportunities
to generate connections with the current and future Hawaiian workforce.

\subsection{Investing in future educators}

Also via the ISEE, we will lead Professional Development Programs (PDPs)
that train graduate students to develop an inquiry based short-course on
instrument development, data-reduction procedures, and machine-learning
methods.  The ISEE PDP began in 2001 via a grant from the NSF to the
Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) at UCSC for training the CfAO graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers, but has now expanded to include
many more disciplines, departments, and international partners.  The
program trains graduate students and postdocs to collaboratively design
a well-focused inquiry activity within a small team.  The activity is
conceived, developed, and tested within the team, and the program
culminates in the team implementing the activity with a group of
undergraduates.  The program emphasizes inclusive and equitable learning
environments.

%\label{sec:training}
%\noindent \comment{1/4 page}

Multiple avenues exist within the current curriculum to include UC
undergraduate students in the development of FOBOS and its public
survey.  At UCSC in particular, we will guide freshman and first year
transfer students through two quarters in Astro 9, a recently started
course that aims to introduce scientific research method early in
students' tenure via timely research projects developed and led by UCSC
graduate students, postdocs, and staff.  Both PI Bundy and co-PI
Westfall have been involved in projects over the past two years,
including a project to measure the rotation curves of galaxies observed
by the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey.  Introducing undergraduates to astronomical
instrumentation would be a unique contribution to this course.

%  We have downloaded FIRST radio image data and extracted cutouts centered on both the red geyser and control samples.
%   Among these we have identified radio detections and performed initial median stacks which are shown in Figure
%   \ref{fig:stacks}.  We find that 19/83 ($\approx23\%$) red geysers and 39/442 ($\approx9\%$) control galaxies are
%   radio-detected.  Our prelminary stacked photometry indicates that with detections removed, the radio flux associated
%   with red geysers is $\approx$7 times stronger than in the control samples.
%
%  \item[] {\bf Proposed Work}: Our preliminary analysis of the FIRST data points to an important result: radio
%  emission, most likely associated with AGN, appears to be elevated among red geysers bolstering our AGN wind
%  interpretation.  Here we propose to complete and publish this analysis.  We will update the red geyser sample using
%  the latest MaNGA catalog ($\sim$5000 galaxies, see Section \ref{sec:stats}) and more carefully vet the stacked
%  samples.  Using deep star formation rate estimates from \citet{chang15}, we will test that radio flux
%  contamination from residual star formation does not affect our conclusions.  Most important, we will develop a Monte
%  Carlo technique to measure the photometric errors on our stacked flux estimates.  This will enable us to assign a
%  confidence level to the significance of the stronger radio flux associated with red geysers.
